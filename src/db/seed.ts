      description: `A 6-station self-paced journey that decodes the patterns of your past, inhabits the zero of the present, and restores the future you were always meant to live. 

This is not a quick fix. This is archaeology, decoding, and restoration—the way trauma healing actually works.

What You'll Learn:
• The framework for understanding trauma as code (patterns that run underneath awareness)
• Somatic practices for settling your nervous system
• Cognitive restructuring: rewriting beliefs that were never yours
• Emotional integration: safe processing of difficult feelings
• Boundary-building for the person you're becoming
• Legacy work: declaring what you choose to pass forward

Ideal For:
- People with unresolved childhood trauma
- Those in recovery from difficult relationships
- Anyone rebuilding after a major life event
- Practitioners and therapists wanting to deepen their own work

Duration: 12-18 hours (self-paced)
Estimated Completion: 4-8 weeks
Price: $197`,
